# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
Lousie is an upcoming playright and has a new play that she has written called 'Fever'. She wants to stage the play and has a budget in the range of $10,000+. She wants to begin a Fundraising campaign on Kickstarter to raise money to help her stage this play.---
### Purpose
Since she is new to the world of fundraising I have prepared a report analysing data relating to fundraising over seven years (2010 - 2017) to provide her with information that would equip her to prepare the fundraising campaign for success. 
## Analysis and Challenges
One of the challenges with the data that I looked at was that it covered all kinds of productions and did not necessarily focussed on brand new productions. Since Lousie's play is new and will be presented for the first time it would have been more relevant to have data that would relate specifically to this category of production.
--- The second challenge is that the data covers audience in the US & Great Britian with campaigns being run for two different audience. We have assumed that theatre goers on either side of the 'pond' have similar tastes and responses.
