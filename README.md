## Overview
Lousie is an upcoming playright and has a new play that she has written called 'Fever'. She wants to stage the play and has a budget in the range of $10,000+. She wants to begin a Fundraising campaign on Kickstarter to raise money to help her stage this play.---
Since she is new to the world of fundraising I have prepared a report analysing data relating to fundraising over the past seven years to provide her with information that would equip her to prepare the fundraising campaign for success.
