# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
Lousie is an upcoming playright and has a new play that she has written called 'Fever'. She wants to stage the play and has a budget in the range of $10,000+. She wants to begin a Fundraising campaign on Kickstarter to raise money to help her stage this play.
### Purpose
Since she is new to the world of fundraising I have prepared a report analysing data relating to fundraising over seven years (2010 - 2017) to provide her with information that would equip her to prepare the fundraising campaign for success. 
## Analysis and Challenges
One of the challenges with the data that I looked at was that it covered all kinds of productions and did not necessarily focussed on brand new productions. Since Lousie's play is new and will be presented for the first time it would have been more relevant to have data that would relate specifically to this category of production.
The second challenge is that the data covers audience in the US & Great Britian with campaigns being run for two different audience. We have assumed that theatre goers on either side of the 'pond' have similar tastes and responses.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

As the chart indicates, the best time to launch the fundraiser would be between April to August. Based on the data available it appears that fundraising campaigns launched between May & July have had the highest rate of success in the past.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

As the chart indicates, it appears that fundraising campaigns that raise less than $5,000 enjoy the highest rate of success. The success rate for campaigns in the range of $10,000 - $15,000 has been 54% in the past.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It wasn't clear where Louise is based, whether she is in the US or the UK.  
## Results
### Conclusions based on Launch Date
I would advise that the window for launching a fundraising campaign needs to be betwen April & August, while keeping in mind that the fundraising campaigns with the highest rate of success were launched between May & July.
When I look at the data from the past three years (2015 - 2017) it appears that the month of May would be the sweet spot to launch a campaign in the window stated above.
### Conclusions based on $$ Goals
Since the budget for the play is at the very minimum $10,000, based on the data we analysed, the probable success rate for a campaign that size is 54%. Funding goals of upto $5,000 have historically had a higher success rate in the past.
### Limitations of the Dataset to keep in mind
The data covers all productions whereas Louise's play is new.
The audience in various countries may have different responses and this has not been factored in.
Amounts pledged eventually realised is not available, there is an assumption that all pledges came to fruition.
###Some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create
The Outcomes based on Launch Date as well as Goals could be further relevant if anaylsed for the past three years and then the results for the overall date be compared to the most result trends. This would help further substantiate or investigate the conclusions drawn.
I would add a table to see the Outcomes based on Launch Date for all the campaigns in order to see if there was any consistency with the successful window for a launch.
Analysing the data based on different currencies would be helpful and may perhaps throw more insight.
